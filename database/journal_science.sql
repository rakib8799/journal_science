Though he was a supporter of individualistic learning, he identified \r\nhimself with universal outlook. Moreover he rendered different sets of moralistic tenets for learner and teacher for a \r\nmeaningful teaching learning process. Above all he was vocal for moral development of young students in a \r\nGandhian line.

Evaluation relied on questionnaires\r\nat inclusion and follow-up visits, and pre/post intervention surveys. The primary outcome was the proportion of persons reporting a use of certified ACT after a positive malaria diagnosis. The secondary outcomes assessed antimalarial adherence, kit use and impact on malaria epidemiology.\r\nFindings: The proportion of patients reporting a use of certified ACT after a positive diagnosis increased\r\nafter the intervention (OR 1.8, 95%CI [1.1-3.0]). From April 2018 to March 2020, 3,733 persons participated\r\nin the intervention.

Finally, the evaluation study procedure was developed taking into account the \r\nefectiveness, usability and efciency of the developed system.\r\nResults To attain the objectives, we proposed a system consisting of a wearable device and mobile application, \r\nwhich allows the users to know their risk levels of having CVDs in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine \r\nLearning (ML) techniques were adopted to develop the system that can classify its users into three risk levels (high, \r\nmoderate and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 80.4% and two risk levels (high and low risk of having CVD) \r\nwith an F1 score of 91%.

He even feared that his sore throat was a sign of tuberculosis and\r\nhe would succumb to it as Keats did. He was also in love, like Keats, with a\r\nwoman who did not reciprocate his love. However, it was not only in his personal\r\nletters that Nazrul talked about Keats, but also in his essays. It is possible that the\r\ninspiration for “Amar Sundar” (My Beauty) came from Keats’ oft-quoted line.\r\nTh is paper will examine selected letters and essays by Nazrul to show how he\r\nappropriated the youngest English Romantic in his writings                                ', 'Qazi Motahar Hossain, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Keats, letters, essays, “Amar Sundar”', 'commentary papers', '', '', '', '', '1685284086.pdf', '1685284086.pdf', '', '1685284086.pdf', 1, 2, '', '', '2023-05-28 14:28:06', '2023-05-28 14:28:06', '0'),

Their words unmask the oppressors\r\nand exploiters who create an obvious gap between social classes, human relationships, and social institutions\r\nwhere people thrive for peace and harmony. This paper will analyze the poems ‘The Rebel’(Bidrohi) by\r\nBangladeshi national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam and ‘Ode to the West Wind’ by the English Romantic poet P.B.\r\nShelley to show the deprivation and suffering of the subalterns, and the voice of the poets against the corruption\r\nand anomalies in their respective societies. This will be qualitative research where data will be collected by\r\nanalyzing the texts and the renowned related critiques and articles from different sources. ‘Theory of Subaltern’\r\nby Antonio Gramsci and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak will be observed in the study to bolster the voices of the\r\npoets. The people in the society who are dominated and deprived by the ruling class for long cannot speak of their\r\nmisery to us. Thus the poets shoulder their responsibilities to carry their voice against injustice and inequalities\r\ntake place in the society through their immortal verses.
